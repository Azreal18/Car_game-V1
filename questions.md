### What happens when "boundary-signal" is weak when compared to the last reward?

When the "boundary-signal" is weak compared to the last reward, the following effects can be observed:

1. **Delayed Boundary Detection**: The system may not recognize the boundary condition promptly, leading to actions that should have been avoided.
2. **Overemphasis on Reward**: The algorithm may prioritize the last reward more heavily, potentially ignoring important boundary conditions that should limit certain actions.
3. **Suboptimal Performance**: The overall performance of the system may degrade as it fails to balance between adhering to boundary conditions and maximizing rewards.
4. **Increased Risk**: In scenarios where boundary conditions are critical (e.g., safety limits), a weak boundary signal can increase the risk of undesirable or dangerous outcomes.

To mitigate these issues, it is important to ensure that the boundary signal is appropriately calibrated and strong enough to influence the decision-making process effectively.
### What happens when Temperature is reduced?

When the temperature is reduced in the context of machine learning models, particularly in the context of sampling from probability distributions (e.g., in language models or generative models), the following effects are observed:

1. **Sharper Predictions**: The model's predictions become more confident and deterministic. Lower temperature values make the probability distribution more peaked, leading to less diversity in the output.
2. **Reduced Variability**: The variability in the generated outputs decreases. The model is more likely to produce the most probable outcomes, reducing the chance of generating less likely alternatives.
3. **Less Exploration**: The model explores fewer possibilities, focusing on the most likely predictions. This can be beneficial for tasks requiring high precision but may limit creativity in generative tasks.
4. **Potential Overfitting**: In some cases, reducing the temperature too much can lead to overfitting to the training data, as the model becomes overly confident in its predictions.

In summary, reducing the temperature makes the model's output more predictable and less diverse, which can be useful for certain applications but may limit the model's ability to generate novel or creative outputs.



### What is the effect of reducing (gamma)?

In the context of reinforcement learning, gamma (Î³) is the discount factor that determines the importance of future rewards. Reducing gamma has the following effects:

1. **Short-Term Focus**: A lower gamma value places more emphasis on immediate rewards rather than future rewards. The agent becomes more short-sighted, prioritizing actions that yield immediate benefits.
2. **Reduced Long-Term Planning**: The agent's ability to plan for long-term rewards diminishes. It may fail to recognize the value of actions that lead to significant rewards in the distant future.
3. **Faster Convergence**: The learning process may converge more quickly because the agent focuses on immediate feedback. However, this can come at the cost of suboptimal long-term performance.
4. **Potential for Myopic Behavior**: The agent may exhibit myopic behavior, making decisions that are beneficial in the short term but detrimental in the long term.

In summary, reducing gamma makes the agent more focused on immediate rewards, which can speed up learning but may lead to suboptimal long-term strategies.
